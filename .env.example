# ServiceNow CMDB Audit App - Environment Configuration

# Development mode credentials (used when running npm run dev)
VITE_APP_USER="your-username"
VITE_APP_PASSWORD="your-password" 
VITE_INSTANCE_URL="https://your-instance.service-now.com/"

# Environment mode override (optional)
# Uncomment to force a specific mode:
# VITE_ENV_MODE="development"  # Force development mode (basic auth)
# VITE_ENV_MODE="production"   # Force production mode (session auth)

# Notes:
# - In development (npm run dev): Uses basic auth with above credentials
# - In production (when deployed to ServiceNow): Uses session token (g_ck) automatically
# - Built app outside ServiceNow: Falls back to development mode for safety
